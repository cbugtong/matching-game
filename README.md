# matching-game
A simple, self-driven matching game to practice with JQuery, styling, and positioning with flexbox.

## how to play
Set a custom number of players (up to 5) and pairs (up to 15). Players take turns flipping cards in an effort to make pairs. Finding a pair gives the player one point. The highest scoring player wins, and in the case of a tie, the player who made the last point wins.

### learning goals
I started working on this after being given an interview prompt, and after the interview session, I decided expand the idea to make a more fully realized experience. I targeted a few technologies that I decided I wanted to learn/be more comfortable with, and so this project is built using 'JQuery' and 'flexbox'. Furthermore, the majority of my previous experience in UI design has been through utilizing predefined API (primarily Bootstrap), so I also wanted to explore designing CSS elements from scratch.

### learning outcomes
In addition to the goals previously outlined, I am also learning to stop feature creep. My idea going into this project would be to create a fully realized product, which in turn meant continuously adding new features. However, in order to move on from this simple project, I had to make a baseline functionality that, although not ideal, is acceptable. I'm allowing myself to come back to this project when the urge arises, but in the interest of other projects, I'll dedicate my time to other endeavors.

### todo
- fix winning player bug (currently, the winning player is the last one to score a point)
- create custom pluralizations for the win message
- allow for custom names of players
